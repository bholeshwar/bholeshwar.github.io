By definition, the problem of unsupervised DA aims at classifying samples from a target domain which is strictly devoid of any label information while assuming that enough training data are available from a related yet non-identical (in terms of data distributions) source domain. A number of existing approaches in this regard are focused towards matching the underlying distributions of the data from both the domains in a shared latent space without explicitly considering: i) the discriminativeness of the embedding space, ii) the usefulness of a manifold distance is pulling the domains towards each other over the standard Euclidean measures. However, we argue the importance of both the aspects in learning the latent space, particularly for fine-grained classes. Our model jointly optimizes both the terms in an end-to-end fashion and the learned latent space is found to properly align the classes with high precision. Experimental results obtained on a hyper-spectral and a multi-spectral dataset confirm the superior performance of the approach over a number of techniques from the literature.","tags":[],"title":"Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Remote Sensing Images Using Metric Learning and Correlation Alignment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jitendra Singh","**Aniruddha Mahapatra**","Saurav Basu","Biplab Banerjee"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554489000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554489000,"objectID":"9b204545eed91ee6e926b9f7715c8077","permalink":"https://anime26398.github.io/publication/igarss19/","publishdate":"2019-04-06T00:00:00+05:30","relpermalink":"/publication/igarss19/","section":"publication","summary":"Real-time monitoring of agricultural crops is an important exercise because of it's huge impact on agri-business and agricultural policy management. Identification of crops during multiple crop growth stages can help formulate better agricultural policies and management strategies. In this context, the objective of this article is to evaluate the potential of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 optical imagery in crop classification for an Indian region. A multi-class classification algorithm based on the support vector machine (SVM) is applied to the temporal features extracted from the above mentioned satellite data sets. The experiments are conducted for Kharif and Rabi crop cycles with major crops in the region. The experiments suggest that the joint use of optical and radar imagery results in better classification accuracy compared to using them individually. An overall accuracy of 89% and 96% is obtained for Kharif and Rabi crops, respectively.","tags":[],"title":"Assessment of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery for Crop Classification in Indian Region During Kharif and Rabi Crop Cycles","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I am working on automatic report generation of chest X-rays as a part of my Bachelor Thesis Project.
